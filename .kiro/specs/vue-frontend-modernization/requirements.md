# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the modernization of the existing vanilla JavaScript frontend implementation to a modern Vue.js-based architecture. The current frontend uses complex vanilla JavaScript with multiple components and services, which has become difficult to maintain and extend. The new implementation will leverage Vue.js 3 with Composition API, Tailwind CSS for styling, and PrimeVue for UI components to create a more maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the current vanilla JavaScript frontend with Vue.js, so that the codebase becomes more maintainable and follows modern development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is accessed THEN the system SHALL render using Vue.js 3 with Composition API
2. WHEN components are developed THEN the system SHALL use Single File Components (.vue files)
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality from the vanilla JS implementation
4. WHEN state management is needed THEN the system SHALL use Pinia for centralized state management
5. WHEN routing is required THEN the system SHALL implement Vue Router for navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern and responsive UI design, so that the interface looks professional and works well on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for all styling
2. WHEN UI components are needed THEN the system SHALL utilize PrimeVue component library
3. WHEN the application is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL be fully responsive
4. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
5. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all existing vanilla JavaScript frontend code, so that there's no legacy code maintenance burden.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have removed all files in the js/ directory
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have removed all vanilla JavaScript components
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have removed all vanilla JavaScript services
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have updated the build configuration
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have no references to the old implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing features to work seamlessly in the new Vue.js frontend, so that I don't lose any functionality during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time communication
2. WHEN VS Code commands are executed THEN the system SHALL process them correctly
3. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle them properly
4. WHEN Git operations are executed THEN the system SHALL maintain full Git functionality
5. WHEN terminal operations are used THEN the system SHALL provide terminal interface capabilities
6. WHEN chat/messaging features are accessed THEN the system SHALL support real-time messaging
7. WHEN server management is performed THEN the system SHALL control server start/stop operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper development tooling and build processes, so that the Vue.js application can be developed and deployed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL use Vite as the build tool
2. WHEN development is active THEN the system SHALL provide hot module replacement
3. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript for type safety
4. WHEN components are developed THEN the system SHALL provide proper linting with ESLint
5. WHEN code is formatted THEN the system SHALL use Prettier for consistent formatting
6. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL generate optimized production bundles

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project structure and organization, so that the Vue.js codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL organize components in logical directories
2. WHEN services are implemented THEN the system SHALL use composables for reusable logic
3. WHEN types are defined THEN the system SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN utilities are needed THEN the system SHALL organize them in dedicated utility modules
5. WHEN assets are managed THEN the system SHALL have proper asset organization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new frontend to have improved performance, so that the application loads faster and responds more quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL have faster initial load times than the vanilla JS version
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use Vue's reactivity system for efficient updates
3. WHEN large lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling where appropriate
4. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading
5. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL have smaller bundle sizes through tree-shaking

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging capabilities, so that issues can be identified and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error boundaries
2. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support Vue DevTools
3. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
4. WHEN development is active THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
5. WHEN production errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the UI
