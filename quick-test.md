# Quick Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
The issue where accessing `localhost:8080/files` directly (or after refresh) resulted in a 404 error has been resolved.

## Root Cause
The HTTP server was not configured to handle Single Page Application (SPA) routing. When you access `/files` directly, the server was looking for a physical file at that path instead of serving the main `index.html` file that contains the Vue.js application.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated HttpServer.ts** - Added SPA routing logic to serve `index.html` for client-side routes
2. **Updated simple-server.js** - Added fallback to `index.html` for non-static routes
3. **Created spa-server.js** - Standalone SPA-aware server for testing

## Test Steps

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
node test-spa-routing.js
```

### 2. Test Direct Access
- Open http://localhost:8080/files in a new browser tab
- Should load the Vue.js application, not show 404
- Navigate to different sections (automation, git, terminal, chat)
- Refresh any page - should still work

### 3. Test WebSocket Connection
- Check browser console for connection logs
- Look for "âœ… Connection service initialized successfully"
- Test file tree loading in the Files section
- Use the "ðŸ”§ Debug" button for detailed testing

## Expected Results
âœ… **Before Fix**: `localhost:8080/files` â†’ 404 Not Found  
âœ… **After Fix**: `localhost:8080/files` â†’ Vue.js application loads correctly

âœ… **Before Fix**: Refresh on `/files` â†’ 404 Not Found  
âœ… **After Fix**: Refresh on `/files` â†’ Application stays on files page

âœ… **WebSocket**: Connection should establish automatically  
âœ… **File Tree**: Should load without timeout errors

## Alternative Test Servers

### Simple SPA Server (HTTP only)
```bash
node spa-server.js
```

### Original Simple Server (Updated)
```bash
node simple-server.js
```

### WebSocket Test Server
```bash
node test-websocket-connection.js
```

## Verification Commands

### Check if servers are running:
```bash
# Check HTTP server
curl -I http://localhost:8080/

# Check WebSocket server (if running)
curl -I http://localhost:8081/
```

### Test SPA routing:
```bash
# Should return HTML content, not 404
curl http://localhost:8080/files
curl http://localhost:8080/automation
curl http://localhost:8080/git
```

## Files Changed
- `src/server/HttpServer.ts` - Added SPA routing methods
- `simple-server.js` - Added SPA fallback logic
- `spa-server.js` - New SPA-aware server
- `test-spa-routing.js` - New comprehensive test script

The fix ensures that your Vue.js Single Page Application works correctly with direct URL access and page refreshes, just like modern web applications should!
