# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mobile-First Index Optimization feature focuses on updating the existing `src/webview/frontend/index.html` file to implement a mobile-first, well-optimized user interface that leverages the enhanced UI components from the web-frontend-enhanced-ui spec. This feature emphasizes mobile-first responsive design, performance optimization, and seamless integration with git workflow management throughout the development process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the web automation tunnel on mobile devices, I want the index.html to be optimized for mobile-first experience, so that I can effectively use the interface on any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the index.html loads on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout with touch-friendly interactions
2. WHEN the viewport is less than 768px THEN the system SHALL prioritize mobile layout patterns and navigation
3. WHEN using touch gestures THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to swipe, tap, and pinch interactions
4. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout smoothly without content loss
5. WHEN loading on slow mobile networks THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical resources and implement progressive loading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the updated index.html to integrate seamlessly with the enhanced UI components, so that I can access all features through a unified, optimized interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the index.html loads THEN the system SHALL initialize the enhanced UI components from the web-frontend-enhanced-ui spec
2. WHEN switching between UI modes THEN the system SHALL maintain state and provide smooth transitions
3. WHEN enhanced features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to basic UI components
4. WHEN loading enhanced components THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
5. WHEN components fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive git workflow management integrated into the development process, so that every change is properly tracked and committed with meaningful messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development work THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated feature branch for the implementation
2. WHEN completing each task THEN the system SHALL commit changes with descriptive commit messages and detailed descriptions
3. WHEN making commits THEN the system SHALL follow conventional commit message format with proper prefixes
4. WHEN a task involves multiple files THEN the system SHALL group related changes into logical commits
5. WHEN the feature is complete THEN the system SHALL have a clean git history with meaningful commit progression

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the index.html to be performance-optimized, so that the interface loads quickly and runs smoothly across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the index.html loads THEN the system SHALL achieve a Lighthouse performance score above 90
2. WHEN critical resources load THEN the system SHALL prioritize above-the-fold content rendering
3. WHEN JavaScript modules load THEN the system SHALL implement code splitting and lazy loading
4. WHEN images and assets load THEN the system SHALL use appropriate compression and modern formats
5. WHEN the interface runs THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance during interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the updated index.html to support progressive web app features, so that the interface can work offline and provide native-like experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the index.html loads THEN the system SHALL register a service worker for offline functionality
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue to function with cached resources
3. WHEN the app is installed THEN the system SHALL provide native-like navigation and interface
4. WHEN push notifications are available THEN the system SHALL support real-time updates and alerts
5. WHEN the app updates THEN the system SHALL handle version management and cache invalidation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive accessibility features in the index.html, so that the interface is usable by developers with different abilities and assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
3. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and visual hierarchy
4. WHEN text is scaled up to 200% THEN the system SHALL remain functional without horizontal scrolling
5. WHEN using voice control THEN the system SHALL support voice navigation and commands

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the index.html to implement modern web standards and security best practices, so that the interface is secure and future-proof.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the index.html loads THEN the system SHALL implement Content Security Policy headers
2. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all data
3. WHEN making network requests THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols and proper authentication
4. WHEN storing data locally THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms and encryption
5. WHEN the interface updates THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with modern web standards
