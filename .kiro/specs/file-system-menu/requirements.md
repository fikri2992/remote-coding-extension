# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a read-only file system menu component for the VS Code extension's webview frontend. The file system menu will provide users with an intuitive interface to browse, navigate, and copy files and directories within their workspace. This feature builds upon the existing file system composable and integrates seamlessly with the WebSocket-based communication architecture.

The file system menu will serve as a file browser and content viewer, offering tree-view navigation and copy operations, while maintaining real-time synchronization with VS Code's file system state through the established WebSocket connection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a hierarchical tree view of my workspace files and directories, so that I can easily navigate and understand my project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview loads THEN the system SHALL display a file tree showing the workspace root directories
2. WHEN a directory node is clicked THEN the system SHALL expand/collapse the directory to show/hide its children
3. WHEN a directory is expanded for the first time THEN the system SHALL load its contents from the server via WebSocket
4. IF a directory is already expanded THEN the system SHALL toggle its collapsed state without server communication
5. WHEN the file tree is displayed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate icons for different file types and directories
6. WHEN a file or directory is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected item visually
7. WHEN the workspace changes externally THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the affected portions of the tree

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to copy file paths and content through context menus, so that I can easily reference and share file information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a file THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with copy operations
2. WHEN I right-click on a directory THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with path copy options
3. WHEN I select "Copy Path" from any context menu THEN the system SHALL copy the full file path to the clipboard
4. WHEN I select "Copy Relative Path" from any context menu THEN the system SHALL copy the workspace-relative path to the clipboard
5. WHEN I select "Copy File Content" from a file context menu THEN the system SHALL copy the file's text content to the clipboard
6. IF a file is binary WHEN I select "Copy File Content" THEN the system SHALL show a message that content cannot be copied
7. WHEN copy operations complete THEN the system SHALL show a brief success notification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for files and directories within my workspace, so that I can quickly locate specific items in large projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter text in the search input THEN the system SHALL filter the file tree to show only matching items
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support both filename and path matching
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight the matching portions of filenames
4. WHEN I clear the search input THEN the system SHALL restore the full file tree view
5. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support case-insensitive matching by default
6. WHEN advanced search is enabled THEN the system SHALL support regex patterns and case-sensitive options
7. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results" message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time updates when files change externally, so that my file tree stays synchronized with the actual file system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is created externally THEN the system SHALL automatically add it to the appropriate location in the tree
2. WHEN a file is deleted externally THEN the system SHALL automatically remove it from the tree
3. WHEN a file is renamed externally THEN the system SHALL automatically update the filename in the tree
4. WHEN a file is modified externally THEN the system SHALL update any relevant metadata (size, modified date)
5. WHEN multiple files change simultaneously THEN the system SHALL batch updates to avoid excessive re-rendering
6. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show a disconnected state and attempt reconnection
7. WHEN the connection is restored THEN the system SHALL refresh the entire tree to ensure synchronization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view file content previews, so that I can quickly understand file contents without opening them in the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a text file THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the file content in a preview pane
2. WHEN I click on an image file THEN the system SHALL display the image in the preview pane
3. WHEN I click on a binary file THEN the system SHALL show file metadata instead of content
4. WHEN previewing large files THEN the system SHALL show only the first portion with an option to view more
5. WHEN the file content changes externally THEN the system SHALL update the preview automatically
6. WHEN no file is selected THEN the system SHALL show a placeholder message in the preview pane
7. WHEN preview loading fails THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see file and directory metadata and properties, so that I can understand file characteristics and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a file or directory THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with basic metadata
2. WHEN I select "Properties" from a context menu THEN the system SHALL display detailed file information
3. WHEN viewing properties THEN the system SHALL show file size, creation date, modification date, and permissions
4. WHEN viewing directory properties THEN the system SHALL show the number of contained files and total size
5. WHEN permissions are displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate read, write, and execute permissions
6. WHEN a file is binary THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the properties and disable text preview
7. WHEN metadata is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate placeholder text

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts for navigation and copy operations, so that I can work efficiently without relying solely on mouse interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Ctrl+C on a selected item THEN the system SHALL copy the file path to the clipboard
2. WHEN I press Ctrl+Shift+C on a selected item THEN the system SHALL copy the file content to the clipboard (if text file)
3. WHEN I press Enter on a selected file THEN the system SHALL show the file preview
4. WHEN I press Space on a selected file THEN the system SHALL toggle the file preview
5. WHEN I press Arrow keys THEN the system SHALL navigate between files and directories
6. WHEN I press Escape during preview THEN the system SHALL close the preview pane
7. WHEN I press Ctrl+F THEN the system SHALL focus the search input

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file system menu to integrate with VS Code for opening files, so that I can seamlessly transition from browsing to editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I double-click on a file THEN the system SHALL open the file in VS Code's main editor
2. WHEN I select "Open in Editor" from a context menu THEN the system SHALL open the file in VS Code
3. WHEN I select "Reveal in Explorer" from a context menu THEN the system SHALL show the file in VS Code's file explorer
4. WHEN opening files THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's file opening API
5. WHEN files are opened THEN the system SHALL maintain focus on the webview unless explicitly requested otherwise
6. WHEN opening fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
7. WHEN opening binary files THEN the system SHALL let VS Code handle the file type appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file system menu to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file reading fails due to permissions THEN the system SHALL show a clear permission error message
2. WHEN file loading fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL show a connection error and retry option
3. WHEN a file cannot be previewed THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate message explaining why
4. WHEN the workspace is not available THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate "no workspace" message
5. WHEN the server is unreachable THEN the system SHALL show a disconnected state with reconnection options
6. WHEN operations time out THEN the system SHALL show a timeout error and allow retry
7. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file system menu to be responsive and performant, so that I can work efficiently even with large project structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large directories THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling to maintain performance
2. WHEN expanding directories THEN the system SHALL load children on-demand rather than loading the entire tree
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL debounce search input to avoid excessive server requests
4. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without blocking the UI
5. WHEN the tree contains thousands of items THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling and interaction
6. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup for collapsed directory contents
