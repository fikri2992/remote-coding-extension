# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web Automation Tunnel feature extends the existing VS Code extension to provide remote web-based control and automation capabilities. This feature will enable users to control VS Code through a web interface by implementing a server API, WebSocket communication, and a web frontend served directly from the extension. The system will include intuitive UI controls for starting/stopping the server and clear visual indicators of the server status.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start and stop a web automation server from within VS Code, so that I can enable or disable remote web-based control of my VS Code instance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Start Server" button THEN the system SHALL initialize an HTTP server and WebSocket server
2. WHEN the server starts successfully THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the server is running
3. WHEN the user clicks the "Stop Server" button THEN the system SHALL gracefully shutdown both servers
4. WHEN the server stops THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicator to show the server is not running
5. WHEN the server fails to start THEN the system SHALL display an error message with the failure reason

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a web interface served by the VS Code extension, so that I can control VS Code remotely through a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL serve a web frontend at a configurable port
2. WHEN a user navigates to the server URL THEN the system SHALL display a functional web interface
3. WHEN the web interface loads THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to the server
4. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL display connection status and retry options
5. WHEN the server is stopped THEN the web interface SHALL display an appropriate offline message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute VS Code commands through the web interface, so that I can automate and control VS Code operations remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is sent via WebSocket THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding VS Code command
2. WHEN a command executes successfully THEN the system SHALL send a success response via WebSocket
3. WHEN a command fails THEN the system SHALL send an error response with details via WebSocket
4. WHEN the web interface sends a command THEN the system SHALL validate the command before execution
5. IF an invalid command is received THEN the system SHALL reject it and return an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time feedback about VS Code state through the web interface, so that I can monitor the effects of my remote commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code state changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast relevant updates via WebSocket
2. WHEN a file is opened or closed THEN the system SHALL notify connected web clients
3. WHEN the active editor changes THEN the system SHALL send editor information to web clients
4. WHEN workspace changes occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast workspace status updates
5. IF multiple web clients are connected THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all clients

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a visually appealing and intuitive interface in the VS Code extension, so that I can easily manage the web automation server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL display server controls in the extension's webview
2. WHEN the server status changes THEN the system SHALL update UI indicators with appropriate colors and icons
3. WHEN displaying server information THEN the system SHALL show the server URL and connection status
4. WHEN the UI renders THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with VS Code's theme
5. IF the server encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages in the UI

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable server settings, so that I can customize the web automation tunnel to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension starts THEN the system SHALL load server configuration from VS Code settings
2. WHEN the user changes server port settings THEN the system SHALL validate the port availability
3. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL use default values and notify the user
4. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL apply the current configuration settings
5. IF configuration changes require restart THEN the system SHALL prompt the user appropriately
