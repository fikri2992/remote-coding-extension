# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ACP Claude Code UI Unification feature transforms the current fragmented ACP integration interface into a unified, streamlined experience that matches Claude Code's feature parity while maintaining the established neobrutalist design system. This feature consolidates the scattered UI panels (ACP Connect, Authentication, Terminal, Session, Prompt, etc.) into a cohesive chat-first interface with integrated development tools, context management, and real-time collaboration features. The goal is to provide users with immediate value through an intuitive, unified workspace that eliminates friction between different functional areas.
