# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a basic VSCode extension written in TypeScript that provides an activity bar with a custom SVG icon and a button that can execute VSCode commands. The extension will focus on core functionality without bloated tests, using manual testing instead. The development process will follow atomic commits with proper branch management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VSCode user, I want to see a custom extension in the activity bar, so that I can easily access the extension's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL display a custom SVG icon in the VSCode activity bar
2. WHEN the user clicks on the activity bar icon THEN the system SHALL open the extension's view panel
3. IF the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL register the activity bar contribution properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a VSCode user, I want to interact with a button in the extension view, so that I can trigger specific VSCode commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension view is opened THEN the system SHALL display a functional button
2. WHEN the user clicks the button THEN the system SHALL execute the "workbench.action.focusAuxiliaryBar" command
3. WHEN the button command is triggered THEN the system SHALL also execute "expandLineSelection" when text input has focus

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to be written in TypeScript, so that I have type safety and better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the extension THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript as the primary language
2. WHEN building the extension THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript to JavaScript properly
3. IF TypeScript compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper type definitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use proper Git workflow with atomic commits, so that I can track changes effectively and maintain clean history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting each task THEN the system SHALL create a new branch for the task
2. WHEN completing code changes THEN the system SHALL make atomic commits with descriptive messages
3. WHEN writing commit messages THEN the system SHALL include task context and change description
4. IF multiple changes are made THEN the system SHALL separate them into logical atomic commits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to avoid bloated test files, so that I can focus on core functionality and use manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the extension THEN the system SHALL NOT include extensive automated test suites
2. WHEN validating functionality THEN the system SHALL rely on manual testing approaches
3. IF testing is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear manual testing instructions
