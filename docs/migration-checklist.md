## üéØ Conclusion and Next Actions

### Current Status
The Terminal Service migration has been completed successfully with all planned features implemented and tested. The implementation provides a robust, secure, and feature-rich terminal service that works independently of VS Code.

However, the Git and File System services still require migration from VS Code dependencies to standalone CLI implementations. These are critical components that need to be completed for the CLI to be fully functional.

### Immediate Next Actions
1. **Start Git Service Migration** - Begin with Phase 1 core CLI Git service structure
2. **Plan File System Service Migration** - Prepare for filesystem service migration
3. **Update Project Timeline** - Adjust timeline to account for remaining migrations
4. **Allocate Resources** - Ensure proper resources are allocated for remaining work

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Complete Git Service migration with all MVP features
- [ ] Complete File System Service migration with all MVP features
- [ ] Achieve 100% CLI independence from VS Code APIs
- [ ] Pass comprehensive testing for all services
- [ ] Complete documentation and user guides

The Terminal Service migration serves as an excellent blueprint for the remaining Git and File System service migrations, demonstrating that a successful, feature-rich CLI implementation is achievable.
