# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mobile File Explorer feature enhances the existing Vue.js webview file explorer with mobile-first design principles, improved touch interactions, and optimized UX for small screens. This feature builds upon the current FileExplorer.vue component and WebSocket integration while adding mobile-specific enhancements like swipe gestures, pull-to-refresh, virtual scrolling optimizations, and responsive design patterns that work seamlessly across all device sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a touch-optimized file explorer interface, so that I can efficiently navigate and manage files on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the file explorer on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display touch-friendly interface elements with minimum 44px touch targets
2. WHEN scrolling through file lists THEN the system SHALL provide smooth momentum scrolling with proper touch feedback
3. WHEN performing swipe gestures THEN the system SHALL support swipe-to-reveal actions for file operations (delete, rename, share)
4. WHEN using pinch gestures THEN the system SHALL support pinch-to-zoom for adjusting file list density
5. WHEN tapping and holding files THEN the system SHALL show contextual actions with haptic feedback where supported

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on various screen sizes, I want a responsive file explorer layout, so that the interface adapts optimally to my device's screen dimensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile screens (< 768px) THEN the system SHALL use a single-column layout with full-width file items
2. WHEN viewing on tablet screens (768px - 1024px) THEN the system SHALL use an adaptive two-column layout with collapsible sidebar
3. WHEN viewing on desktop screens (> 1024px) THEN the system SHALL maintain the current three-column layout with enhanced touch support
4. WHEN rotating device orientation THEN the system SHALL smoothly adapt the layout without losing current navigation state
5. WHEN switching between screen sizes THEN the system SHALL preserve expanded folders and selected files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want intuitive navigation gestures, so that I can quickly move through directory structures and perform common file operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swiping left on a file item THEN the system SHALL reveal quick action buttons (delete, rename, share)
2. WHEN swiping right on a file item THEN the system SHALL show file preview or open action
3. WHEN pulling down on the file list THEN the system SHALL trigger refresh with visual feedback
4. WHEN using two-finger swipe up THEN the system SHALL navigate to parent directory
5. WHEN double-tapping a folder THEN the system SHALL expand/collapse with smooth animation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with limited bandwidth, I want optimized loading and caching, so that the file explorer performs well on slow mobile connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading file trees THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading with skeleton screens
2. WHEN scrolling through large directories THEN the system SHALL use virtual scrolling to maintain performance
3. WHEN navigating previously visited folders THEN the system SHALL use cached data with smart refresh logic
4. WHEN on slow connections THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and allow cancellation of operations
5. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL display cached file structure with clear offline indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want enhanced visual feedback and animations, so that interactions feel responsive and provide clear status information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing file operations THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators with estimated completion time
2. WHEN files are loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loading animations that match the final content structure
3. WHEN operations succeed or fail THEN the system SHALL show toast notifications with appropriate icons and colors
4. WHEN navigating between folders THEN the system SHALL use smooth slide transitions that indicate navigation direction
5. WHEN files are selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual selection feedback with subtle animations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved file preview capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and work with files without opening them in VS Code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tapping on image files THEN the system SHALL show inline image previews with zoom capabilities
2. WHEN tapping on text files THEN the system SHALL show syntax-highlighted code previews in a modal
3. WHEN tapping on markdown files THEN the system SHALL show rendered markdown preview
4. WHEN previewing files THEN the system SHALL support swipe gestures to navigate between files in the same directory
5. WHEN closing previews THEN the system SHALL return to the exact scroll position in the file list

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with the existing WebSocket architecture, so that all mobile enhancements work with the current VS Code extension communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing file operations THEN the system SHALL use the existing WebSocket commands and maintain backward compatibility
2. WHEN receiving file system events THEN the system SHALL update the mobile UI with appropriate animations and feedback
3. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show mobile-optimized offline state with retry options
4. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL sync any missed file system changes with visual indicators
5. WHEN multiple clients are connected THEN the system SHALL handle real-time updates with conflict resolution UI

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an accessibility-conscious user, I want the mobile file explorer to be fully accessible, so that I can use it with screen readers and assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic markup for all interactive elements
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
3. WHEN using voice control THEN the system SHALL respond to voice commands for common file operations
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and visual hierarchy
5. WHEN using reduced motion settings THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences and disable non-essential animations
