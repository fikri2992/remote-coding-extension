# Enhanced Terminal Capabilities Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the terminal capabilities in Kiro to provide a full-featured, interactive terminal experience that rivals native CLI tools. The current implementation provides basic PTY support with fallback mode, but lacks essential features like command history, arrow key navigation, auto-completion, and advanced keyboard shortcuts that are expected in modern terminal applications.

The enhanced terminal will support running advanced CLI tools like `claude-code`, interactive applications, and provide a seamless development experience on mobile and desktop platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Keyboard Navigation and Input Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to navigate and edit commands using arrow keys, home/end keys, and other standard terminal keyboard shortcuts, so that I can efficiently work with command-line tools and edit complex commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press the left/right arrow keys THEN the cursor SHALL move character by character within the current command line
2. WHEN I press Ctrl+A or Home THEN the cursor SHALL move to the beginning of the current line
3. WHEN I press Ctrl+E or End THEN the cursor SHALL move to the end of the current line
4. WHEN I press Ctrl+Left/Right THEN the cursor SHALL move word by word
5. WHEN I press Backspace THEN the character before the cursor SHALL be deleted
6. WHEN I press Delete THEN the character at the cursor SHALL be deleted
7. WHEN I press Ctrl+K THEN all text from cursor to end of line SHALL be deleted
8. WHEN I press Ctrl+U THEN all text from cursor to beginning of line SHALL be deleted
9. WHEN I press Ctrl+W THEN the word before the cursor SHALL be deleted

### Requirement 2: Command History Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access my previous commands using up/down arrow keys and search through command history, so that I can quickly rerun or modify previously executed commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press the up arrow key THEN the previous command in history SHALL be displayed in the input line
2. WHEN I press the down arrow key THEN the next command in history SHALL be displayed in the input line
3. WHEN I press Ctrl+R THEN a reverse search mode SHALL be activated to search through command history
4. WHEN I type in reverse search mode THEN matching commands from history SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN I press Enter in reverse search mode THEN the selected command SHALL be executed
6. WHEN I press Escape in reverse search mode THEN reverse search SHALL be cancelled
7. WHEN a command is executed THEN it SHALL be added to the command history
8. WHEN the terminal session ends THEN command history SHALL be persisted for the next session
9. IF command history exceeds 1000 entries THEN the oldest entries SHALL be removed

### Requirement 3: Auto-completion and Suggestions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent auto-completion for commands, file paths, and command options, so that I can work more efficiently and reduce typing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Tab THEN the system SHALL attempt to auto-complete the current word
2. WHEN multiple completions are available AND I press Tab twice THEN all possible completions SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN typing a command THEN the system SHALL suggest available commands based on PATH
4. WHEN typing a file path THEN the system SHALL suggest available files and directories
5. WHEN typing command options THEN the system SHALL suggest available flags and options for known commands
6. WHEN auto-completion is triggered THEN the completion SHALL be case-insensitive
7. WHEN a completion is selected THEN it SHALL replace the current partial word
8. WHEN no completions are available THEN the Tab key SHALL insert a literal tab character

### Requirement 4: Advanced Terminal Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced terminal features like copy/paste, text selection, and terminal customization, so that I can have a productive terminal experience comparable to native applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select text with mouse or touch THEN the selected text SHALL be highlighted
2. WHEN I copy selected text THEN it SHALL be available in the system clipboard
3. WHEN I paste text THEN it SHALL be inserted at the current cursor position
4. WHEN I press Ctrl+C THEN the current running process SHALL receive SIGINT
5. WHEN I press Ctrl+Z THEN the current running process SHALL receive SIGTSTP
6. WHEN I press Ctrl+D THEN EOF SHALL be sent to the current process
7. WHEN I double-click a word THEN the entire word SHALL be selected
8. WHEN I triple-click a line THEN the entire line SHALL be selected
9. WHEN the terminal is resized THEN the PTY SHALL be notified of the new dimensions

### Requirement 5: Interactive Application Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run interactive CLI applications like `claude-code`, `vim`, `nano`, and other TUI applications, so that I can use my preferred development tools through the terminal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run an interactive application THEN it SHALL receive proper terminal capabilities information
2. WHEN an interactive application uses cursor positioning THEN the cursor SHALL move to the correct position
3. WHEN an interactive application uses colors THEN colors SHALL be displayed correctly
4. WHEN an interactive application clears the screen THEN the terminal display SHALL be cleared
5. WHEN an interactive application uses alternate screen buffer THEN it SHALL switch to alternate screen
6. WHEN an interactive application exits alternate screen THEN it SHALL restore the previous screen content
7. WHEN an interactive application requests terminal size THEN it SHALL receive accurate dimensions
8. WHEN running `claude-code` or similar AI tools THEN they SHALL function with full interactivity

### Requirement 6: Mobile-Optimized Input Experience

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want an optimized input experience with virtual keyboard support and touch-friendly controls, so that I can effectively use the terminal on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a mobile device THEN a virtual keyboard helper bar SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN I tap Ctrl in the helper bar THEN subsequent key presses SHALL include Ctrl modifier
3. WHEN I tap Alt in the helper bar THEN subsequent key presses SHALL include Alt modifier
4. WHEN I tap Tab in the helper bar THEN a tab character SHALL be inserted
5. WHEN I tap Esc in the helper bar THEN an escape character SHALL be sent
6. WHEN I long-press the helper bar buttons THEN they SHALL remain active for multiple key presses
7. WHEN I tap arrow keys in the helper bar THEN the cursor SHALL move accordingly
8. WHEN the virtual keyboard appears THEN the terminal SHALL adjust its layout to remain visible
9. WHEN I use touch gestures THEN they SHALL be translated to appropriate terminal actions

### Requirement 7: Session Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage multiple terminal sessions and have session persistence, so that I can work on multiple tasks simultaneously and resume work after disconnections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new terminal session THEN it SHALL be assigned a unique session ID
2. WHEN I have multiple sessions THEN I SHALL be able to switch between them using tabs or a session list
3. WHEN I close a session THEN it SHALL be properly terminated and resources cleaned up
4. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN sessions SHALL remain active on the server
5. WHEN the WebSocket connection is restored THEN I SHALL be able to reconnect to existing sessions

7. WHEN I explicitly close the terminal page THEN all sessions SHALL be properly disposed
8. WHEN the server restarts THEN all sessions SHALL be cleanly terminated

### Requirement 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the terminal to be responsive and handle high-throughput output efficiently, so that I can run commands that produce large amounts of output without performance degradation.

2. WHEN output exceeds display buffer limits THEN older content SHALL be scrolled out of view
3. WHEN typing rapidly THEN there SHALL be no noticeable input lag

7. WHEN multiple terminal sessions are active THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's performance
8. WHEN running on mobile devices THEN the terminal SHALL maintain acceptable performance levels
