# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing ChatPage.tsx into a sophisticated, AI-powered chatbot interface that integrates seamlessly with cotg-cli's development workflow. The enhanced chatbot will provide intelligent assistance for development tasks, code analysis, and project management while maintaining the existing neobrutalist design aesthetic and WebSocket-based communication architecture.

The enhanced chatbot will transform the current basic chat interface into a comprehensive development assistant that can understand context, provide code suggestions, analyze files, and integrate with the existing ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) system for advanced AI capabilities.

5. WHEN a user requests project analysis THEN the system SHALL scan and provide insights about the codebase structure
6. WHEN files are modified during conversation THEN the system SHALL track and highlight changes
7. WHEN a user asks about errors THEN the system SHALL integrate with the workspace's problem/diagnostic information

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Conversation Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize my conversations into topics and sessions, and have the chatbot remember context across sessions, so that I can maintain productive long-term development discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new conversation THEN the system SHALL create a named session with automatic topic detection
2. WHEN a user switches between sessions THEN the system SHALL preserve and restore the complete conversation context
3. WHEN a conversation becomes long THEN the system SHALL provide conversation summarization and key points extraction
4. WHEN a user searches conversations THEN the system SHALL provide full-text search across all messages and sessions
5. WHEN a user exports a conversation THEN the system SHALL generate markdown or PDF format with proper formatting
6. WHEN the system detects a new topic THEN the system SHALL suggest creating a new conversation thread
7. WHEN a user deletes a session THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and provide recovery options

### Requirement 4: Advanced AI Integration and ACP Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chatbot to leverage advanced AI capabilities through the ACP system and provide intelligent code analysis, suggestions, and automated tasks, so that I can accelerate my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ACP system is available THEN the chatbot SHALL integrate with it for enhanced AI capabilities
2. WHEN a user asks for code analysis THEN the system SHALL provide detailed insights about code quality, patterns, and improvements
3. WHEN a user requests code generation THEN the system SHALL create contextually appropriate code with proper formatting
4. WHEN a user asks about best practices THEN the system SHALL provide project-specific recommendations based on the current codebase
5. WHEN the system detects potential issues THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest fixes and improvements
6. WHEN a user requests refactoring THEN the system SHALL analyze dependencies and provide safe refactoring suggestions
7. WHEN multiple AI models are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose and switch between different models

### Requirement 5: Real-time Collaboration and Streaming

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see AI responses as they are being generated and collaborate with team members in real-time, so that I can have fluid, interactive conversations and share insights with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI response is being generated THEN the system SHALL display a typing indicator and stream the response in real-time
2. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL show who is online and their activity status
3. WHEN a user is typing THEN the system SHALL display typing indicators to other connected users
4. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL provide delivery and read receipts
5. WHEN the connection is unstable THEN the system SHALL queue messages and retry sending automatically
6. WHEN responses are streaming THEN the system SHALL allow users to stop generation early
7. WHEN long responses are generated THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and estimated completion time

### Requirement 6: Customizable Interface and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a developer with specific accessibility needs and preferences, I want to customize the chatbot interface appearance and behavior, so that I can have an optimal experience that matches my workflow and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for theme customization, font sizes, and layout preferences
2. WHEN a user has accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL support screen readers, keyboard navigation, and high contrast modes
3. WHEN a user prefers different layouts THEN the system SHALL offer compact, comfortable, and spacious message density options
4. WHEN a user wants to customize shortcuts THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of keyboard shortcuts for common actions
5. WHEN the interface is used on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design optimized for touch interaction
