# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web Frontend Enhanced UI feature transforms the existing basic web automation interface into a modern, chat-like interface with comprehensive development tools. This feature will provide a sidebar navigation system with organized functionality including prompt management, git integration, file management, and system information. The core interaction model shifts from command-based to conversational, with prompts automatically saved to a `.remoterc` folder for history and reuse.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern chat-like interface for sending prompts, so that I can interact with VS Code in a conversational manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a chat-like UI with messages flowing from top to bottom
2. WHEN I send a prompt THEN the system SHALL display my message in the chat interface immediately
3. WHEN VS Code responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface below my prompt
4. WHEN I send a prompt THEN the system SHALL create a new file in the `.remoterc` folder with the prompt content
5. WHEN displaying chat messages THEN the system SHALL show timestamps and clear visual distinction between user and system messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a sidebar navigation with organized functionality, so that I can easily access different features of the web automation tunnel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with navigation menu items
2. WHEN I click on "Prompt" in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL show the chat-like prompt interface
3. WHEN I click on "Git" in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL show git status, commits, and current diff in a card-like UI
4. WHEN I click on "File Manager" in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL show all workspace files in a tree structure
5. WHEN I click on "Info" in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL show current extension and server information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an integrated git interface, so that I can monitor repository status and changes through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the git section THEN the system SHALL display current branch information
2. WHEN viewing the git section THEN the system SHALL show recent commits in a card-like layout
3. WHEN viewing the git section THEN the system SHALL display current diff/changes in a readable format
4. WHEN git status changes THEN the system SHALL update the git interface in real-time
5. WHEN there are uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL highlight them clearly in the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a file manager interface, so that I can browse and open workspace files through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the file manager THEN the system SHALL display workspace files in a tree structure
2. WHEN I click on a file THEN the system SHALL send a command to VS Code to open that file
3. WHEN I expand a folder THEN the system SHALL show its contents without full page reload
4. WHEN files change in the workspace THEN the system SHALL update the file tree in real-time
5. WHEN displaying files THEN the system SHALL show appropriate file type icons and metadata

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want prompt history and management, so that I can reuse and organize my prompts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send prompts THEN the system SHALL save them to files in the `.remoterc` folder with timestamps
2. WHEN viewing prompt history THEN the system SHALL display previous prompts in chronological order
3. WHEN I click on a previous prompt THEN the system SHALL allow me to resend or edit it
4. WHEN managing prompts THEN the system SHALL allow me to organize them into categories or tags
5. WHEN the `.remoterc` folder doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want responsive design and modern UI components, so that the interface works well across different screen sizes and provides a professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the interface on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
2. WHEN interacting with UI components THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
3. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use modern card-based layouts and visual hierarchy
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL follow VS Code's design language and color scheme
5. WHEN displaying large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL implement proper scrolling and pagination

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time updates and synchronization, so that the web interface stays current with VS Code state changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code state changes THEN the system SHALL update the relevant UI sections in real-time
2. WHEN files are modified in VS Code THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the file manager
3. WHEN git operations occur THEN the system SHALL update the git interface immediately
4. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL synchronize state across all clients
5. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync any missed updates
