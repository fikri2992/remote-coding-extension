# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the current VS Code extension-based web automation tunnel application to a standalone Terminal User Interface (TUI) application. The migration aims to remove VS Code API dependencies while preserving all core functionality and enhancing the terminal-based user experience using modern TUI libraries like Ink and Chalk.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Architecture Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the web automation tunnel as a standalone CLI/TUI application, so that I can use it without requiring VS Code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize without any VS Code API dependencies
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide all current functionality through a terminal interface
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL maintain the same HTTP server, WebSocket server, and tunnel management capabilities
4. IF VS Code APIs are encountered THEN the system SHALL replace them with Node.js native equivalents

### Requirement 2: Terminal Interface Replacement

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive terminal interface to replace the VS Code webview, so that I can manage servers and tunnels efficiently from the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a rich TUI using Ink components
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates for servers and tunnels
3. WHEN users navigate the interface THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts and menu navigation
4. WHEN the interface updates THEN the system SHALL use Chalk for colored output and visual feedback
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages in the TUI

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want configuration to be managed through files and CLI arguments instead of VS Code settings, so that I can configure the application independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from JSON/YAML files in a .config directory
2. WHEN users provide CLI arguments THEN the system SHALL override file-based configuration
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without restart
4. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear validation errors
5. WHEN no configuration exists THEN the system SHALL create default configuration files

### Requirement 4: Pseudo Terminal Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want terminal functionality to work without VS Code's pseudo terminal API, so that I can execute commands through the TUI application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terminal sessions are created THEN the system SHALL use node-pty instead of VS Code's pseudo terminal
2. WHEN terminal input is received THEN the system SHALL process it through the native PTY implementation
3. WHEN terminal output is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in the TUI interface
4. WHEN terminal sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain session persistence and recovery
5. WHEN multiple terminals are active THEN the system SHALL support tabbed or windowed terminal management

### Requirement 5: Command System Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want command execution to work without VS Code command palette, so that I can trigger actions through the TUI interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL use a custom command registry instead of VS Code commands
2. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are pressed THEN the system SHALL trigger corresponding actions in the TUI
3. WHEN commands complete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback through the terminal interface
4. WHEN command errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error information in the TUI
5. WHEN commands require input THEN the system SHALL prompt users through terminal input dialogs

### Requirement 6: File System Operations Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file system operations to work independently of VS Code workspace APIs, so that I can manage files through the TUI application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations are requested THEN the system SHALL use Node.js fs APIs instead of VS Code workspace APIs
2. WHEN working directory is determined THEN the system SHALL use process.cwd() or user-specified paths
3. WHEN file watching is needed THEN the system SHALL use chokidar or native fs.watch
4. WHEN file paths are resolved THEN the system SHALL handle absolute and relative paths correctly
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages in the TUI

### Requirement 7: Server Management Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage HTTP and WebSocket servers through the TUI, so that I can control the web automation tunnel without a graphical interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TUI displays server status THEN the system SHALL show real-time port, connection count, and uptime information
2. WHEN users start/stop servers THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and status updates
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggested actions
4. WHEN multiple servers are running THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive status dashboard
5. WHEN server configuration changes THEN the system SHALL prompt for restart confirmation

### Requirement 8: Tunnel Management Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage Cloudflare tunnels through the TUI, so that I can create and monitor tunnels without VS Code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tunnel creation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide interactive prompts for tunnel configuration
2. WHEN tunnels are active THEN the system SHALL display public URLs, status, and connection information
3. WHEN tunnel operations are performed THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and completion status
4. WHEN multiple tunnels exist THEN the system SHALL provide a list view with management options
5. WHEN tunnel authentication is required THEN the system SHALL securely prompt for tokens and credentials

### Requirement 9: Logging and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities in the TUI application, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
2. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL display detailed operation logs in the TUI
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log stack traces and context information
4. WHEN log files are written THEN the system SHALL rotate logs and manage file sizes
5. WHEN debugging is active THEN the system SHALL provide real-time log streaming in the interface

### Requirement 10: Package and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have minimal dependencies and clear packaging, so that it can be easily distributed and installed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is packaged THEN the system SHALL remove all VS Code-specific dependencies
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use only necessary Node.js packages
3. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL support multiple distribution formats (npm, binary)
4. WHEN installation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions and requirements
5. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL support self-update mechanisms

### Requirement 11: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the TUI application to work consistently across different operating systems, so that I can use it on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL handle Windows-specific path and command differences
2. WHEN the application runs on macOS/Linux THEN the system SHALL utilize Unix-specific features appropriately
3. WHEN terminal operations are performed THEN the system SHALL adapt to different shell environments
4. WHEN file operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle platform-specific file system behaviors
5. WHEN the application is distributed THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific installation packages

### Requirement 12: Data Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current VS Code extension configuration and data to be migrated to the TUI application, so that I don't lose my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is performed THEN the system SHALL detect existing VS Code extension configuration
2. WHEN configuration is migrated THEN the system SHALL convert VS Code settings to TUI configuration format
3. WHEN data migration occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve tunnel configurations and credentials
4. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of migrated settings
5. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and manual migration guidance
