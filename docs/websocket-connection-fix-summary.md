# WebSocket Connection Timing Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

The infinite loading issue on the files page (and other pages) was caused by a **WebSocket connection timing race condition**:

1. **React components mount** and immediately send WebSocket requests in `useEffect`
2. **WebSocket connection** may not be fully established yet
3. **Requests are lost** because they're sent before the connection is ready
4. **Loading states remain stuck** because no response is ever received

## Root Cause Analysis

### Before Fix:
```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN: Sends requests immediately without checking connection state
const { sendJson, addMessageListener } = useWebSocket();

useEffect(() => {
  // This runs immediately on mount, potentially before WebSocket is connected
  sendJson({ type: 'fileSystem', id: 'fs_123', data: { ... } });
}, [filePath]);
```

### After Fix:
```typescript
// ✅ FIXED: Waits for connection before sending requests
const { sendJson, addMessageListener, isConnected } = useWebSocket();

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isConnected) return; // Wait for connection
  sendJson({ type: 'fileSystem', id: 'fs_123', data: { ... } });
}, [filePath, isConnected]); // Include isConnected in dependencies
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. FileViewerPage.tsx ✅
**Issue:** File content loading indefinitely when accessing URLs like `/files/view?path=/package.json`

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `isConnected` to WebSocket hook destructuring
- Added connection check in useEffect: `if (!filePath || !isConnected) return`
- Added `isConnected` to dependency array: `[filePath, isConnected]`

### 2. FilesPage.tsx ✅
**Issue:** File tree loading indefinitely when accessing `/files` page

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `isConnected` to WebSocket hook destructuring
- Added connection check in `requestTree` function: `if (!isConnected) return`
- Added connection check in useEffect: `if (!isConnected) return`
- Added `isConnected` to dependency array: `[location.search, isConnected]`

### 3. GitPage.tsx ✅
**Status:** Already properly implemented (no changes needed)

The GitPage was already correctly waiting for WebSocket connection:
```typescript
// Already correct implementation
if (isConnected) {
  request('status');
  request('diff');
  request('log', { count: logCount });
}
```

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Provider Implementation
The `WebSocketProvider` already exposed the necessary `isConnected` state:

```typescript
interface WebSocketContextType {
  isConnected: boolean;        // ✅ Available
  connectionCount: number;
  lastActivity: string | null;
  sendJson: (message: any) => boolean;
  addMessageListener: (handler: (data: any) => void) => () => void;
}
```

### Connection State Management
- `isConnected` becomes `true` when WebSocket `onopen` event fires
- `isConnected` becomes `false` when WebSocket `onclose` event fires
- Components now wait for `isConnected: true` before sending requests

### Message Flow (Fixed)
1. **Component mounts** → `isConnected: false` → No requests sent
2. **WebSocket connects** → `isConnected: true` → useEffect re-runs
3. **Requests sent** → Server processes → Responses received
4. **Loading states cleared** → UI updates with data

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   node out/cli/index.js start --port 3900 --skip-build
   ```

2. **Test file browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3900/files`
   - Verify file tree loads without infinite spinner
   - Click on files to open them
   - Verify file content loads without infinite spinner

3. **Test page reload:**
   - Reload the page (F5) while on files page
   - Verify it still loads correctly (this was the main issue)

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Test WebSocket connection timing
node test-websocket-connection-fix.js
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### ✅ File Browser (`/files`)
- File tree loads successfully on first visit
- File tree loads successfully after page reload (F5)
- No "Path outside workspace" errors
- No infinite loading spinners

### ✅ File Viewer (`/files/view?path=/file.txt`)
- File content loads successfully on first visit
- File content loads successfully after page reload (F5)
- No infinite loading spinners
- Proper error handling for invalid paths

### ✅ Git Page (`/git`)
- Already working correctly (was properly implemented)
- Git history loads without issues
- Commit diffs display correctly

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- **Eliminates lost requests** - No more messages sent before connection ready
- **Reduces server load** - No duplicate/retry requests from stuck loading states
- **Improves user experience** - Consistent loading behavior across page reloads

### Minimal Overhead:
- **Connection state check** - Simple boolean check, negligible performance cost
- **Additional dependency** - `isConnected` in useEffect dependencies, standard React pattern

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, revert these changes:

1. **FileViewerPage.tsx:**
   ```typescript
   // Revert to: const { sendJson, addMessageListener } = useWebSocket();
   // Remove: isConnected checks and dependency
   ```

2. **FilesPage.tsx:**
   ```typescript
   // Revert to: const { sendJson, addMessageListener } = useWebSocket();
   // Remove: isConnected checks and dependency
   ```

3. **Rebuild frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd src/webview/react-frontend && npm run build
   ```

## Future Improvements

### 1. Request Timeout and Retry
```typescript
// Add timeout handling for stuck requests
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
  setError('Request timeout - please try again');
  setLoading(false);
}, 10000);
```

### 2. Connection Status Indicator
```typescript
// Show connection status to users
{!isConnected && (
  <div className="bg-yellow-100 p-2 text-sm">
    Connecting to server...
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. Request Queuing
```typescript
// Queue requests when disconnected, send when reconnected
const [requestQueue, setRequestQueue] = useState([]);
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] File browser loads without infinite spinner
- [x] File viewer loads without infinite spinner  
- [x] Page reload works correctly (main issue)
- [x] No "Path outside workspace" errors
- [x] WebSocket connection state properly managed
- [x] All existing functionality preserved
