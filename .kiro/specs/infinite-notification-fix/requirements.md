# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VS Code extension's Vue.js frontend is experiencing infinite error notifications that make the application unusable. While a temporary fix has been implemented by disabling notifications, a comprehensive solution is needed to implement proper error handling, connection management, and user experience improvements. This feature will establish robust error handling patterns and prevent similar issues in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without infinite error notifications, so that I can use the interface normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL NOT display any automatic error notifications
2. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without creating notification loops
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load all UI components successfully without error cascades

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent error notifications that don't overwhelm me, so that I can focus on important issues without distraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL implement error throttling to prevent duplicate notifications
2. WHEN the same error occurs multiple times THEN the system SHALL show it only once within a configurable time window
3. WHEN errors are categorized as low severity THEN the system SHALL log them without showing notifications
4. WHEN errors are categorized as high severity THEN the system SHALL show immediate notifications with recovery options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear connection status feedback, so that I understand when the application is connected to the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically attempt WebSocket connections
2. WHEN I manually initiate a connection THEN the system SHALL provide clear status feedback
3. WHEN connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with maximum retry limits
4. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show a single notification and allow manual reconnection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the file system menu to work offline, so that I can browse files even when not connected to backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the file system menu SHALL initialize without requiring WebSocket connection
2. WHEN offline THEN the file system menu SHALL show cached or default content
3. WHEN connection is established THEN the file system menu SHALL update with live data
4. WHEN connection is lost THEN the file system menu SHALL continue working with last known state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error boundaries and recovery mechanisms, so that component failures don't crash the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Vue component encounters an error THEN the system SHALL contain the error within that component
2. WHEN a component fails THEN the system SHALL display a fallback UI instead of breaking the entire page
3. WHEN store operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without triggering notification cascades
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide recovery actions to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automation interface to work reliably, so that I can execute VS Code commands without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the automation view THEN the system SHALL load without errors
2. WHEN I execute commands THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback without error notifications
3. WHEN connection is required for commands THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate connection requirements
4. WHEN commands fail THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages with suggested actions
