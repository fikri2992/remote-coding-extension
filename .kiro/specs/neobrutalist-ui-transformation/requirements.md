# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Neobrutalist UI Transformation feature redesigns the existing React frontend components to follow neobrutalist design principles. This transformation will replace the current clean, minimal UI with a bold, high-contrast design system featuring thick borders, vibrant colors, strong typography, and geometric shapes. The goal is to create a distinctive, memorable user experience that stands out from typical web applications while maintaining full functionality and accessibility.
